# TrackSimulator

I've worked as the tower operator at my local drag strip for over half a decade. I'm very familiar with the computer system and calculations that go on behind the scenes from when the cars pull up to the moment the winner light turns on. Unfortunately a lot of companies that make track timing software have cripplingly poor UI/UX, outdated data management, and error-prone systems. Out of frustration (and a little spite) I want to see if I can make my own UWP app to run a drag strip tower system from start to finish.

# Goals
My goals are to have management for driver lists, race classes, searching of results, and time slip printing as well as creating competition ladders and qualifying brackets.

# Limitations
I don't have a live data feed from timing sensors to hook into with this app (unless my track upgrades, then it's game on!). I want to spin up a simulator function that will create an entire race day's worth of runs (350+).

# Bonus Game
For kicks and giggles I may add a reaction timer too - it's fun to see how good or bad your own reaction times are whether you're looking at a screen or sitting in a vehicle.
